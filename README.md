- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pavan Kumar studying Mathematics in Science and Engineering at TUM. This is my new account as the older one got frozen. I have worked in Max-Planck as a machine learning engineer in the Erosita project and am currently doing my internship in ZEISS in my project using ML/DL algorithms. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning and executing state-of-the-art technologies in real-world problems. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing real-world projects and learning how can we use technology to solve them.
